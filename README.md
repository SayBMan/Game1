# Game1

This is a top-down 2D game I am currently developing to learn Unity and game development. It uses basic game elements such as combat and collection. I am trying to create a Souls-like experience with a basic leveling and progression system. I am currently working with premade Sprites.

I update the project files every day as I work on them.
